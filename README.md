The international portion of the data is updated with input from agricultural attachés stationed at U.S. embassies around the world, FAS commodity analysts, and country and commodity analysts with ERS. The U.S. domestic component is updated with input from analysts in FAS, ERS, the National Agricultural Statistical Service, and FSA.
